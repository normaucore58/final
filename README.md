# Final Project
Based upon the feedback from your final (midterm) round of comps, transform your visual designs into their final format: a coded web site.

## Guidelines
- Fork & clone this repository.
- Create a new branch called `gh-pages`.
- Use web-standard-compliant, well-formed, valid, accessible, and semantic markup (HTML) to best structure the content of your site.
- Use external cascading style sheets (CSS) to position your layout & style your user interface.
- Work bug-free on all browsers on both platforms
  + PC: Firefox, IE9+, Opera, Chrome
  + MAC: Safari, Firefox, Opera, Chrome
- Turn in your final assignment by creating a pull request.

## Purpose/Objective
- Use current web programming technologies to build a fully interactive web site.
- Create the most effective user interface for your targeted audience.
- Defend the conceptual merits of your own designs.
- Meet the needs and deadlines dictated by your client.
